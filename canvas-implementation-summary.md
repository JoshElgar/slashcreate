# Canvas Implementation Summary

## What We've Done

We've successfully converted the PlantBoids component from a DOM-based implementation to a Canvas-based implementation while maintaining exact visual parity. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Boid Logic**

   - Ported all flocking algorithms (cohesion, separation, alignment)
   - Maintained the same boid movement patterns and behaviors
   - Preserved the edge-driving behavior

2. **Portal System**

   - Implemented both border and center portals
   - Maintained portal transit effects and teleportation
   - Preserved the visual appearance of portals

3. **Interaction**

   - Maintained click-to-spawn functionality
   - Preserved the same boid spawning behavior
   - Kept the same random properties for new boids

4. **Visual Appearance**
   - Matched the paper airplane shape exactly
   - Preserved opacity and fade effects
   - Maintained the same colors and styling

## Files Changed

1. `src/components/PlantBoidsCanvas.tsx` - New Canvas implementation
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated to use the Canvas implementation

## Benefits

The Canvas implementation should provide better performance, especially with larger numbers of boids, while maintaining the exact same visual appearance and behavior as the original DOM-based implementation.

## Next Steps

The implementation can be tested by running the application and comparing the visual appearance and behavior with the original implementation. No visual differences should be noticeable to users.
